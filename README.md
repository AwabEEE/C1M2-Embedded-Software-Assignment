## 📁 Project Overview

This assignment demonstrates basic memory manipulation in embedded C for both `HOST` and `MSP432` platforms using a Makefile-based build system. It includes:

- Custom Makefile for flexible compilation
- Abstraction for memory operations in `memory.c/.h`
- Platform-specific configuration using preprocessor flags
- Version control with Git
- Successfully pushed to GitHub
